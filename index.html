            <p>Food is a source of health, energy and enjoyment. Few things in life provide as much pleasure as a
                delicious meal shared with family or friends, and nothing can do more for your total health and
                well-being - glowing skin, bright clear eyes, your stamina and strength, immune system, even your mood -
                as the right sort of food and the right proportions.Nutrition is all about looking after yourself and
                eating to stay fit and healthy. Along with exercise and stress management, it’s one of the three things
                that can have a huge impact of how well you feel, how much energy you have over the day and how in shape
                you stay.

                In today’s busy world, it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking there’s not enough time to cook or
                that it’s easier to order a home delivered pizza. But this is short-sighted. It’s never been easier to
                eat for health, because today’s menus are fresh and light, without the rich sauces and heavy desserts of
                the past. In addition, supermarkets and food stores now offer convenient ingredients and meals that can
                be reheated at home and offer a healthier alternative to take-away foods.</p>
